    <p>How I ponder these dreams I had
        It was our taming
        Our own Carpophorus
        Get back up regain your substance
        This sigil on your chest it means nothing anyway

        Sits well with golden platters you’re killing me
        The severance of all those tiny beings
        You’re like nothing I’ve seen before
        Like the angels you cause me panic but bring me peace
        Like the silver winds and the spectral honors
        See them holding hands and chanting our blessings

        I spectate the rotting Kodak
        The sides how they’ve burnt from the fire
        I never seen as much peace in one night as that I have that one
        We should turn back there are soldiers there</p>

    <p>I admit that every night
        I opt to see by candlelight
        In this room where the Dodechild cries
        I too have been left behind
        I wish I could explain why
        Your words have always made me high


        First made contact with thine eyes
        Shot with Cupid’s arrows till I died
        While picking flowers in my
        Acacia gardens grown in my mind
        I wish I could find why
        Jumped off the nest but cannot fly

        Veniste
        Vidisti
        Vicisti, help me

        Am I, the machine, the kino eye
        Paranoid or looking through my own lies
        All the stars watching in the sky
        Could not remind me of why
        So I’ll have to hold my head up high
        I’ll have to swallow your words dry</p>

        Wash your hair with fruit gushers
        Goddamn these racing stripes
        I wear on my chest

        I stare at the blue wall
        And see the happy people
        They’re all such happy people
        At least when they aren’t being fakes
        I don’t miss being one of those fakes


        Pierced by my truth


        Am I trying to hide from something
        And if I do will it still find me
        Then I’ll show myself with joy
        Oh please eradicate me


        Before you really think you’re sure tell me
        Who the fuck was Jesus’ savior?


        Make me regret being empty
        Because it only hits harder when
        I stare at the blank white wall
        And think of all the sweet little hearts I tore apart
        I took those sweet hearts and tore them apart
        Before I put a bullet through my skull
        It stuffed some self realization in that bloody hole

        But it this really cathartic?

    <p>All around the world
        Darkness runs away from you
        You'd never raise your hand against a child
        All along the way
        Darkness tries to run away from you
        You'll never hurt a starving child


        I just count the days
        I wish I had the nerves
        If I fall asleep
        I'll just lose my chance
        I'll sleep away my days
        I'll sleep away the years

        I can't stop it now
        The life is seeping out of me
        A whole new world is opened right in front of me
        But everything feels right
        I won't want to ruin it
        I just feel it's best to hold it back

        I just count the days
        Ill never have the nerves
        I'll just fall asleep
        So I can lose my chance
        I'll sleep away my days
        Maybe that's how it should be

    <p>No tiene preguntas
        Como tu brillar Tu siempre baila
        Mi solo camino
        No llores, mi angela
        Todo es bueno el bordo
        Todo siento tu mano y alma
        Demasiado cosas(Nosotros ventana)
        Muerto de estrellas(Es muy dolorosa)
        No puedo recuerdo(no lo creo)
        Ver todo color de rosa
        Creo tu aura
        Golpes donde duele
        Yo quiero tu ojos
        Ser mi guía para la paz
        Yo ver una fantasma
        Abajo la mesa
        Y no despertará</p>
